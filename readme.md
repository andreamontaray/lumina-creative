## Inpiration and Learning

Lumina Creative was created as a project for the "Modern HTML & CSS from the Beginning (2024 Revamp)" course by Brad Traversy. The course provided a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles.

## Improvements and Customizations

After completing the course, I revisited the initial design and made several improvements to enhance the website's functionality and user experience.

Some notable improvements include:

- Adding a logo link in the navbar and footer for better branding and navigation
- Implementing transitions and hover effects on buttons and images to enhance visual feedback
- Adding links and hover effects on social media icons to improve connectivity
- Modifying the navbar to be fixed and transparent on scroll, providing a smoother user experience

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

One of the challenges faced during development was creating the gallery section using flexbox instead of grid. However, this challenge helped improve problem-solving skills and familiarity with CSS flexbox properties.

Another valuable lesson learned was the importance of creating reusable utility classes and understanding personal preferences in coding styles.
